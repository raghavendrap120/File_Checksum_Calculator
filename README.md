# File_Checksum_Calculator

Checksum is a value calculated from a data set with the purpose of verifying the integrity of the data. It is a form of error detection that ensures data integrity during transmission, storage, or retrieval. A checksum is typically a fixed-size numerical value derived from the data using a specific algorithm or formula.

When data is transmitted or stored, a checksum can be calculated for the data at the source. This checksum is then sent along with the data. At the receiving end, the data is recalculated, and the newly calculated checksum is compared with the received checksum. If the two checksums match, it indicates that the data was transmitted or stored without any errors or alterations. If the checksums do not match, it suggests that the data may have been corrupted or tampered with.

Checksums are commonly used in various applications, including network protocols (such as TCP/IP), file transfer protocols (such as FTP), error correction techniques, and data storage systems. They provide a simple and efficient way to verify data integrity and detect errors or alterations in a data set.
